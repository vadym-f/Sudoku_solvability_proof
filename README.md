# Sudoku_solvability_proof
efficient proof of solvability with characteristic polynomials

We demonstrate practical verification of private information
in the context of verifing existence of Sudoku solution.
We start from verification with characteristic polynomials,
to appropriate circuit and source code.
Our circuit is of lower complexity (number of constraints),
compared to Bowe-Maxwell FC'16.
Circuit is created with libsnark, an advanced proof system implementation.
