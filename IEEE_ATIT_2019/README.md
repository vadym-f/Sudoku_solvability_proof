# Sudoku and zk-SNARKs at the IEEE ATIT 2019 conference, Kiev State University

These two reports were submitted, reviewed, and presented at the conference.
It happen, IEEE Latex Template -based pdf can not be published in this IEEE proceedings.

Private Sudoku solution verification and 'secret multiplication table'
were serving as an introduction to SNARKs and R1CS.

SNARK-verifiable hash-to-curve (SWU algorithm) was probably considered highly experimental.
This proof-of-concept project was accomplished in July 2019,
before Wahby-Boneh CHES report,
and before Mercer O(1) Labs presentation at zk0x04.
Source code was not released.
Fast-forward into 2021, you could see SWU in NU5 specifications.
